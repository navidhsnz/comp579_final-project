# comp579_final-project

## Project Files
The components of the program are located in different files including:
- train.py: contains a class called Agent which involves all necessary initializations and the code responsible for training the agent and updating the neural netowork weights.
- DQN.py: contains the DQN implementation.
- memory.py: contains the memory buffer implementations.
- gridWorldEnv.py: contains the customized gridworld environment for experiments 2 and 3.

## Experiments
The tree experiments each have tehir own .ipynb file which invilves everything regarding their parameters and their results. After running the experiments, these codes store the experiment results in files within a folder called "experiment_data" to have easy access to them later.

## How to (Re)run the Experiments
simply run the codes withing experiment{1,2,3}.ipynb files.
